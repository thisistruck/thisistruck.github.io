    <h2>Electric Soft Parade</h2>
<p><img src="../images/artistimages/esp_med.jpg" class="itemimage" alt="Electric Soft Parade"/>Electric Soft Parade are the brothers White, Alex and Tom. As teenagers their debut album ‘Holes in the Wall’ became a Mercury nominated album in 2002. Released on the BMG backed dB records, they achieved two top 40 singles and critical acclaim. The second album, The American Adventure’, quickly followed in 2003.
</p><p>
At this point the band were becoming disillusioned with the major label machine. The brothers turned their attention to Brakes, a band formed in Brighton with Alex and Tom, Eamon Hamilton (formerly with British Sea Power) and Marc Beatty (The Tenderfoot). In between tours with Brakes, the White brothers booked themselves in a studio for a week, and ‘The Human Body EP’ was recorded. 2006 also saw the long awaited debut of the band in the US, with their first shows at SxSW in Texas and in New York. 
</p><p>
For the rest of 2006, when not on tour or in the studio with Brakes, Electric Soft Parade returned to the Truck Studios to record their third album, ‘No Need to Be Downhearted’, released in 2007 to acclaim everywhere. It is an eclectic record filled with more tunes and more fine detail than most groups manage in a career. The band have spent the rest of the year reminding live audiences everywhere of the quality of their songs and musicianship, when not recording or playing with their other bands- Tom is also in Restlesslist and Alex performs with Actress Hands.
