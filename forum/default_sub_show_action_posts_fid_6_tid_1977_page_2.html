<p>As&nbsp;a steward this year I can only apologise for our lack of any significant&nbsp;conribution to the festival. I understand that owing to how there were at least 200 of us running around most of the day, that&nbsp;several of us should have been&nbsp;stood in the unlit spots of the sight, waiting to leap&nbsp;to the rescue of any unfortunates that, like your poor girlfriend, lack balance.&nbsp;Next year, I will ensure to do this rather than picking up old burgers or&nbsp;empty cans or bits of glass etc&nbsp;that we foolishly saw as a more important endevour.&nbsp;We may not have been 100% up to date with everything that went on everywhere at all times, and again, can only apologise for the lack of God like knowledge amongst the student&nbsp;volunteers. Again, we will rectify this&nbsp;by not supplying toilet paper to all the loos, and will instead focus&nbsp;on becoming&nbsp;psychic.</p>
<p>Once again, my sincere apologise for being useless. But&nbsp;as an overall&nbsp;conclusion, you're a wanker, don't bother coming next year, we struggled putting wristbands on&nbsp;however many guests as it was. One less would be appriciated.&nbsp;</p></font></td>

							<td>I couldn't disagree more. This festival was run fantastically. Having spent the previous weekend at the love box festival this was a breath of fresh air to the overflowing loos, poor sound systems and long long queues at the bar, but the thing is that was still excellent. if you can't come to a festival with the attitude of making the best of what you can almost guarantee will be a smelly, massy and muddy affair then maybe sticking to your more regimented indoor events is best for you. <br>I would like to thank the organizers and staff and all involved for a great weekend and bring on next year. . . . ./////////////////////<br>Nonclassical club @ The Macbeth. . . . .

Since when did this become an attack site for some valid points? I too support neddone's opinion, as do several of my friends. We've been going to Truck for 7 years now, and &nbsp;we all think that it didn't seem as well organised this year as it has been in the past 2 or 3. The reason behind this? We don't know. But if Neddone has got off his/her arse and made some enquiries as to why, then good on him/her. It shouldn't be slated as some of you have done. It's feed-back on these sort of things that hopefully get taken on board and help to make future Trucks better&nbsp;- isn't THAT what it's all about?</font></font></td>
