							<td>- What did you enjoy at TRUCK this year?<br><br>Everything! Ace bands, brilliant atmosphere, great fun to had after the bands were finished (The Village Pub indie disco thing was superfun), great food... I could go on for ages but I'll leave it at that. Everyone in my group of 12 had an amazing time.<br><br>- What was your favourite band?<br><br>Obviously seeing Supergrass was a treat but my favourite was probably We Were Promised Jetpacks. Or The Joy Formidable. Or And So I Watch You From Afar... or (I'll stop now). This was my fourth Truck now and the quality of bands was by far the best yet.<br><br>- What was your favourite stage or area?<br><br>The barn has to win because of the ace bands and the huge sound system... honourable mentions though to the Beat Hive and the Boxford bit.<br><br>- How did you find the food and drink?<br><br>Excellent as always... brie and cranberry baps followed with a banana smoothie? Yes please.<br><br>- How were the camping facilities?<br><br>The fields seemed to be better spaced out and easier to navigate than previous years but maybe that's just me. The toilets were still immaculate on the monday morning (except for what can only be described as a MOUNTAIN of poo in one of them but that's hardly your fault as it defied logic).<br><br>- Anything not so good?<br><br>There were a few annoying clashes (Frank Turner on at the same time as Supergrass mainly) but that's always going to happen... and we missed a couple of bands in the barn because we turned up late and security wouldn't let anyone else in even though it was only half full... minor niggles though.<br><br>- Any suggestions for improvements or additions for next time?<br><br>Bring back the disco shed! Maybe have signs outside all of the stages like there were outside the barn and village pub saying what was on. More urinals would be good too.<br><br>- Any performers you'd like to see at future TRUCKs?<br><br>Maybe bring back some bands from Trucks of old... 65daysofstatic, Mystery Jets, Blood Red Shoes... Biffy as headliners? I don't know how you'll follow Ash and Supergrass though to be honest!</td>

<p>The vast majority of it! I think the Sunday was slightly better though, due to the line up.</p>
<p><br><strong>- What was your favourite band?</strong></p>
<p>The Joy Formidable... immense!</p>
<p><br><strong>- What was your favourite stage or area?</strong></p>
<p>The Barn, definitely. It's so cool! However, it was annoying how this year we had to queue to get in/ security weren't letting people in even though it was only at about half capacity..</p>
<p><br><strong>- How did you find the food and drink?</strong></p>
<p>Good! I think I spent more money that I do at other festivals, simply because it was cheaper than other festivals and so as a matter of principle I was actually happy to buy stuff!</p>
<p>I think there could be a bit more variety for food.. after having the same things for breakfast/lunch/dinner for two days it gets a bit annoying!</p>
<p><br><strong>- How were the camping facilities?</strong></p>
<p>Good, no problems!</p>
<p><br><strong>- Anything not so good?</strong></p>
<p>Just the problems about getting in to the Barn as I mentioned above. And I think the Beat Hive could be made a bit bigger now (although it is a really cool design!)- or possibly open the entrance to it that is opposite the stage so that more people can see from outside?</p>
<p><br><strong>- Any suggestions for improvements or additions for next time?</strong></p>
<p>Letting more people in to the Barn</p>
<p>Opening up The Beat Hive a bit more</p>
<p>More variety in food stalls</p>
<p><br><strong>- Any performers you'd like to see at future TRUCKs?</strong></p>
<p>Blood Red Shoes, The Joy Formidable, Soft Toy Emergency</p></font></td>
