    <h2>About</h2>
<h3>Who We Are and What We Offer</h3>
<p>Truck Workshops is an initiative from the people who bring you the annual Truck Music festival in Oxfordshire.<br/>
<br/>
We specialise in connecting schools and other community groups to professional working artists from various backgrounds: crafts people, musicians, actors, dancers, and photographers. <br/>
<br/>
With the help of professionally trained teachers, the artists create innovative workshops that can be tailored to the requirements of individual groups. <br/>
<br/>
Our artists are highly skilled, friendly and keen to work with you to provide an unforgettable experience. <br/>
<br/>
We can arrange a variety of workshop services including one-off events, festival activities, art weeks or longer residencies. <br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why work with professional artists?</h3>
<p>Our artists bring an influence from the creative industries not normally available within a school or community group setting.<br/>
<br/>
They provide introductions to the creative industries and produce fresh and innovative approaches to learning.<br/>
<br/>
Artists can make learning come alive and inspire people to pursue their own creative interests.<br/>
<br/>
Our workshops can be tailored to benefit people of all ages and are easily applicable to mixed ability groups.&nbsp; They are also a great way to form productive links between different parts of the community.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why bring artists into a school?</h3>
<p>In a school setting workshops can be used to tackle issues which directly affect pupils&rsquo; lives and environments.<br/>
<br/>
The workshops are flexible and adaptable and we are able to work collaboratively with teachers to help address different topics.<br/>
<br/>
Our workshops can be used to help achieve the aims laid out in the National Curriculum, and wherever relevant we will try to incorporate current education initiatives.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
We employ a professional teacher to advise each of our artists, and we will provide a workshop pack with consent forms, health and safety assessments and details of the curriculum aims and objectives covered in the workshop activities. <br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why is creativity so important?</h3>
<p>Today more than ever the National Curriculum is placing an emphasis on the need for creativity in education.&nbsp; The key message is that &lsquo;creativity improves pupils self esteem, motivation and achievements&rsquo;.<br/>
<br/>
We support the aims of the national curriculum, and believe that creativity, in all its many forms, is an essential and enriching part of everybody&rsquo;s life.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to act and think creatively is not just an artistic pursuit; it is a skill transferable to all areas of life.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Getting creative can help people:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reach their potential</li>
    <li>Invent new ideas</li>
    <li>Learn new skills</li>
    <li>Be inspired</li>
    <li>Feel confident</li>
    <li>Develop new perspectives&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Out and About</h3>
<p>Getting creative outside is a great way to introduce people to their local environments.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
By encouraging people to explore and have fun in their environments they will be inspired to help protect these places in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Have a look at what&rsquo;s coming up for details of some of our outdoor events, or speak to our team about arranging your own outdoor workshop.<br/>
<br/>
If you have an outdoor space you think we may like to use, let us know and we will come down and have a look.</p>
<h3>Our Foundations</h3>
<p>These three ideas form a backdrop to all of the work we do:<br/>
<br/>
CREATIVE LEARNING FOR ALL</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Inspire creativity, confidence and achievement by encouraging imagination and exploration</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Provide an enjoyable, inclusive learning environment free from judgement, and give value to different levels of creative talent; it is the creative process that is of importance</li>
    <li>Make our services accessible to everyone</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
FLEXIBILITY AND RELEVANCE</p>
<ul>
    <li>Work with non-prescriptive learning styles and remain adaptable to current issues effecting (affecting?) communities or groups, and help tackle these issues through our work</li>
    <li>Learn from co-created knowledge, reflect on our practices and invite the evaluation of others</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
SUSTAINABILITY</p>
<ul>
    <li>Always consider our environment and the impact of the work we do</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Run a self-sustainable business and form mutually beneficial relationships in the community</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
