    <h2>Goldrush</h2>
<p><img src="../images/artistimages/goldrush_med.jpg" class="itemimage" alt="Goldrush"/>Goldrush was born when Garo met Robin, Joe and G, then of Whispering Bob, at an instore gig in Abingdon and they realised their shared love of Neil Young, Nick Drake and The Band, a rare thing in the villages of the Abingdon triangle. Soon their demos and live shows were demonstrating a rare songwriting gift. In 2001 they released ‘Same Picture’ on their own Truck label. Although recorded in Robin's bedroom, the single captured the attentions of Virgin Records. Virgin quickly locked the band in Abbey Road Studios over the Christmas period, and the results were unveiled in 2002 as their debut album ‘Don’t Bring Me Down’. The highlight of 2002 was the tour in support of The Flaming Lips, although they were also playlisted across the land, from BBC Radio 2 to XFM. In October 2002, the relationship with Virgin came to an end, with both parties deciding that they just weren't suited to each other, and Goldrush returned home to Truck.
</p><p>
With full control of their own band, Goldrush ‘rushed’ into 2003, producing the ‘Extended Play EP’ at the beginning of the year, and touring the world with Mark Gardener. The experiences of America (being stranded in the middle of nowhere with a broken van) contributed to an EP, called ‘Ozona’, released that summer. ‘Ozona’ was expanded into a full album, featuring recordings with legendary sonic genius Dave Fridmann, and released in the US by Better Looking Records. 2006 was Europe’s turn to experience Goldrush. With City Slang looking after the European release of Ozona, the band spent the coldest month of the year performing in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
</p><p>
After all the touring, the band finally returned to the studio (or in this case Garo’s shed) to record a new album, this time about their real and spiritual home -‘The Heart is the Place’. Recorded with electronic pioneer Pedro, AKA James Rutledge, the album is the sound of the band reaching new dimensions, to produce a record that we believe will stand the test of time with its quality songwriting and experimental sounds. At South by Southwest 2007 audiences were blown away by the trombone-wielding live show, and the band's most recent show, at Union Hall New York, was a sell-out triumph. Right now the band are working on hard on the next decade of Truck as well as recording and playing live with numerous other acts.
