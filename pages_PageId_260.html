    <h2>Foundation Projects</h2>
<p>
On August 1st there will be environmental art based in the woodland setting of Hinksey Heights. Children accompanied by their parents, will be able to roam the woods, collecting materials and knowledge from their surroundings. Different methods of representation will be encouraged and artworks made that can remain in the woodland until their natural decay.
At the same setting will be a day of music as children and their parents gather, singing and making music with nature. This will take place on August 20th. There will be the chance to learn songs from around the globe, and create soundscapes in this peaceful environment.
</p><p>
Taking place throughout August will be a series of shorter workshops at North Abingdon Children's Centre and Dalton Barracks. 
These will include activities that encourage children to be creative with their resources, using twigs to build with, the weather as inspiration, and the groups will be based outside whenever possible.
Parents are asked to attend as the workshops are planned to provide activities that can be easily carried out at home.
