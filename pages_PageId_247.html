<h3>The Piney Quilting Bee</h3>
<p>
Take part in the making of:<br>The Truck 10-Year Anniversary Commemorative Quilt.
</p><p>
Get involved for charity!
</p><p>
A good old-fashioned quilt is a priceless treasure.  Each stitch is tenderly accomplished; with the individual squares carefully thought out.  Everyone should have a family quilt and this year at the Truck Festival people can get involved in making the Truck Family quilt.  The quilt will be auctioned in a silent auction at the festival and proceeds will go to The Haven House Children’s Hospice.
</p><p>
<i>“What the heck is a quilting bee?”</i> you may ask…  A quilting bee was an important means of socialising for colonial and pioneer women.  Through the winter months the women would create their quilt squares.  Since there was no central heating in these homes, there was usually only one main heated room that was too crowded during the winter months for a quilt frame to be assembled. When the weather became warmer, an invitation was sent to the surrounding neighbours for the quilting bee.  The quilters would come from all the nearby towns and countryside to stitch the quilt squares together, chatting and telling stories; sharing the latest gossip or giving advice.  The quilting bee was an important part of the social life of these people surpassed only by church gatherings.
</p><p>
Piney’s Grandma Margie is queen bee of her church quilting circle, having spearheaded the annual charity fundraiser at her local Lutheran church.  So Piney is bringing her family tradition to Steventon to celebrate Truck Festival’s 10 year anniversary in style as well as raising money for a worthy cause.  Get involved, all are welcome so spread the word!
</p><p>
The brief:  Get a square of fabric 8 inches by 8 inches and decorate the square in any way you like, with thread, cloth, fabric glue, glitter, paint, buttons, beads, ANYTHING so long as it has a truck on it, or is truck related/truck inspired.  Bring your quilt square to the Truck festival and stitch it on.  The quilting bee will take place in the Market Field all day Saturday and Sunday, the quilt will be presented to the winner of the silent auction before the Sunday headliner on the main stage.  
</p><p>
If you want to make a square but will not be attending the Truck Festival, message Piney’s Craft Collective through myspace and you will be told where to send your square.  Submissions accepted up until July 19th so get stitching!
